# Cansat
This CanSat is a miniature satellite model built inside a can. It uses an Arduino Nano as its brain to collect data from its sensors. The key feature is a LoRa radio module, which allows it to transmit this data over a long distance to a laptop ground station during its descent, mimicking how real satellites communicate.
